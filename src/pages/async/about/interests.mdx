My interests are programming, gaming, photography, and reading. I'm also a Linux fan
and have been using it as my main OS since 2024.

For photography, I use a Canon EOS M50 Mark I and a Nothing Phone (2). I have two lenses,
a 15-45mm and a 55-200mm, plus a tripod.

For gaming, I mostly play Minecraft, along with War Thunder, Rocket League, Geometry Dash,
osu!, and more.

I'm also a fan of Tensura, having watched all seasons and read the mangas. Plus, I'm a huge fan
of ThinkPads and own one. I also work with a Raspberry Pi 4 and several SBCs.

Lastly, I'm a fan of mechanical keyboards and follow Linus Tech Tips ([Holy Sch\*\*ÃŸe](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxghr_D7g8DQQw5-4xgRD0cl8ne_xJsyyC)).
