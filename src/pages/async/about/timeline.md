## 2014/15 - The beginning

I started programming with Scratch when I was around 7-8 years old. One of my first projects was building an OS in Scratch.

## 2020 - Java, and Minecraft Server Networks

I started learning Java and was part of a Minecraft Server Network project called "Vipecity", where I eventually became a moderator and developer.

## 2021 - 2022 - Growth & Learning

I joined a team for CantByPass.me, a DDOS protection and VPN service, while also mastering JavaScript and Typescript.

## 2022 - 2024 - Back to the projects

I started learning Go and built several projects including Tatake, a Discord bot, and custom-caddy for modified binaries.

## 2024 - now (2025) - Linux as main OS

I switched to Linux as my main OS, testing Manjaro, Garuda, Arch, Nobara, and finally settling with CachyOS. I also started my pacman repo.
