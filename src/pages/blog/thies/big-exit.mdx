Maybe some of you have read, watched, or heared the news in recent times.
A big wave of users are leaving X because of the current controversy of Elon Musk.
If you didn't know of it, here are some sources:

## Users are leaving X

Many users, including me, are leaving X because Elon Musk has done many controversial, and very critical things in the past few months. So, I'm switching.

I'm now on [Mastodon](https://sueden.social/@Minecodes), and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/mcds.moe). Those are the best alternatives for me, and I can only recommend them to you. Those are also the platforms where most users migrated to.

## My reasons

I have many reasons to leave X, but the most important ones are:

 - Elon Musk's controversial tweets
 - The ensh\*tification of the platform
 - The lack of moderation
 - The politification of non political accounts (e.g. my own account)
 - Too many right wing accounts flooding my feed (not interested in them)
 - The amount of ads, crypto scams, and fake news

May you have a good day, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask me on Mastodon or Bluesky. Have a good day!
