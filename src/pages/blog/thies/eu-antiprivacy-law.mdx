# 'Impact assessment on retention of data by service providers for criminal proceedings' - A Controversial Initiative by the European Commission
<Badge type="error">Content Warning: Political Content</Badge>

## How I found out about this initiative

It was in the morning of the 27th of May. Normally, I would just look for some nerdy news or articles on Hacker News, and then proceed to travel to school.
But it was different on that morning. I read the headline "EU plans new mass surveillance law mandating data retention, built-in backdoors".

Now this is not the first time that someone in the EU Commission tries to push a law for mass surveillance or to weaken encryption (glaring at some German and French politicians).
But this time, it was different. This time, the source behind this proposal is anonymous. To make this more clear, I think this anonymous feedback from a French user sums it up quite well:
> At first glance, the proposed regulation appears to be just another flawed attempt to balance security and privacy.
> But a closer look, especially at the High-Level Group (HLG) advice the EU cites as a foundational source, reveals something far more dangerous.
> First, when German MEP Patrick Breyer requested the names of the individuals behind the so-called High-Level Group that drafted this sweeping proposal, the EU responded with a list where every single name was redacted.
> A law that would introduce unprecedented surveillance powers across Europe is being built on recommendations from an anonymous and unaccountable group.
> In any democracy, this would be a scandal. In the European Union, it is an outright betrayal of public trust.
> > https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14680-Impact-assessment-on-retention-of-data-by-service-providers-for-criminal-proceedings-/F3562526_en

Now, I am not a lawyer, I am not a politician, and I am certainly not out of school yet but even I can see how dangerous this is.
We don't know who is behind this proposal, and we don't know what their intentions are.

## What is the 'Call for evidence'?

Because it's important that you understand what this initiative is about, I will quote the official summary of the initiative:
> Certain metadata processed by service providers are needed to effectively fight crime. Since no EU-wide legal framework exists requiring providers to retain metadata for a reasonable and limited period of time for criminal proceedings, data may no longer exist by the time authorities request them. The divergences between EU Member States’ laws governing the retention of data can hamper criminal proceedings and affect service providers operating across the EU. This initiative is to assess the impact of data retention rules at EU level.

Also, important to note is that this initiative is still in the feedback phase, and was made as an act of the type "Staff working document".
I can't show you every detail of the initiative, but I can show you the most important parts. For more details, please read official 5 page document that is referenced as the second source.

## What does this mean for you?
To come back to the part before my quick detour, this initiative is highly controversial, as it aims to collect data from users without their consent and to connect those data with their real identity.

To make matters worse, the proposal wants to collect effectively all data of a user, and that tied to their legal identity at that.
This is not only a violation of our privacy, but also a violation of our fundamental rights.

To sum the worst points up, I'd like to quote the same user I did before:
> Civil society was excluded while powerful lobbyists shaped one of the most consequential digital laws of our time behind closed doors. A blunt overreach of state power: Universal identification and data retention, every click, message, and connection must be logged under your legal name, turning the entire population into perpetual suspects. Encryption smashed: providers must supply data in an intelligible way (Rec 27.iii), forcing them to weaken or bypass end-to-end encryption whenever asked. Backdoors by design: hardware and software makers are ordered to bake permanent law-enforcement access points into phones, laptops, cars, and IoT devices (Rec 22, 25, 26). Privacy shields outlawed: VPNs and other anonymity tools must start logging users or shut down. Criminalized resistance: services or developers who refuse to spy on their users face fines, market bans, or prison (Rec 34). No one exempt: the rules cover every electronic communication service, from open-source chat servers to encrypted messengers to vehicle comms systems (Rec 17, 18, 27.ii). A mass surveillance law, drafted in secrecy by unknown actors, with provisions that go beyond what we see in many authoritarian regimes. And yet, the European Commission is advancing it as if its routine policy work.

"Crack down on encryption"... This in it alone is the biggest red flag for me. If you weaken encryption, you don't only weaken it for those, who need it for "legitimate" reasons, but also for those, who have malicious intentions.
It could simply be hackers (good or bad ones), but also goverments. It would be a dream of every authoritarian regime to spy on anyone and everyone. We don't need to look far for examples, just look at China, Russia or Iran. They all have one thing in common: They want to control their citizens, and they want to know everything about them.
I mean, it would be "great" to know that this one important politician is corrupt or has a secret, which could be used for their own gain. Or "hey, this person is a journalist, who is investigating us, let's just spy on them and see what they are up to".
This is not just any thing, this is a violation of our fundamental rights, and it is a violation of our privacy. This is something that nobody wants. "Oh but I don't have anything to hide." Oh but yes, you do. Would you want to have your private and most intimate conversations in the open?
Would you like to have those pictures, where you are naked, or when you were doing something embarrassing in your private life, for everyone to see? But also, have you thought, who would have access to this data?

Now, there are some big questions that need to be answered:
 - Who is behind this initiative?
 - How should whisleblowers be protected?
 - How can we ensure that this data is not misused?
 - How can we ensure that this data is not used for mass surveillance?
 - Why don't they begin at the root of the problems they want to "solve"?
 - Why don't they focus on the criminals, instead of the innocent people?

##

Now, I don't know the answers to these questions, but I know that we need to fight against this initiative.
We need to make our voices heard, and we need to tell the European Commission that this is not acceptable.

To quote some of the (at the time of writing) 3100+ (short) responses to the initiative:

> Privacy is a human right and no one is being made safer by giving it up. This proposal, written by a secret group of people, is a danger to the citizens of the EU. I strongly oppose this overreach.

--------------------------------------

> The initiative could (and will) invade people's privacy which EU is already trying to protect (e.g. GDPR law). It is backwards and does not preserve people's right to privacy. I do not agree with the initiative. It is unlawful and against human rights.

--------------------------------------

> I strongly object to any initiative reducing privacy rights, be it online of offline. Especially this proposal should not be passed, as it would harm the digital freedom of all citizens AND of all businesses located in the EU - and this only for an alleged possibility that some crimes might be uncovered easier (which is not certain at all, according to reports of actual police organisations).

--------------------------------------

> An abhorrent and extremely dangerous proposal. Digital privacy is a matter of basic human rights. Mass surveillance and data retention of all citizens goes against everything that the EU is supposed to stand for: freedom and democracy. I do not and will never approve of this!

> Surveillance does not grant safety. Nobody is going to be better off if their fundamental rights to privacy and data protection are violated and privacy-friendly alternatives are blocked, outlawed or shut down. Especially with digitalisation being increasingly forced on everyone, willing or not, a guideline like this would make it impossible for anyone to maintain digital privacy. This includes journalists, therapists, doctors, social workers, whistleblowers, and everyone else who has legitimate reasons to be concerned about digital surveillance. Digital sovereignty would be greatly impacted by this proposal. It would make it vastly more difficult to host services, even on a very small scale, rendering decentralisation, self-hosting and the small web untenable while benefiting large platform providers that already take control away from users. I expect the EU to continue acting in the best interests of its citizens and discard this outrageous proposal.

--------------------------------------

> Free and unsupervised communication is one of the important factors of democracy. This includes metadata: which websites I access, which whom I chat, etc., that is highly sensitive data. The government should not be allowed to track this kind of data in advance. This is even more dangerous with the raise of autocratic regimes, e.g. for women in the US data of apps tracking the menstrual cycle is used for oppression, same for accessing specific webpages etc. And any data that is collected can leak. We know this. We had big leaks of all kinds of data from large social networks, from Microsoft, from government organisations and so on. Additionally while the data can (and will) be used for surveillance it rarely helps to prevent or impede crimes. Also requiring all kind of small providers to set up surveillance infrastructure including open source and hobby projects is another step to hamper small or voluntary online services and turn everyone to large (often US- or China-based) providers with even more data collection (and even less privacy). We went through all these arguments several times. We had the discussions on national level in various countries, including rulings from constitutional courts. Please just stop. Stop surveillance. Privacy is important!

-> The "eschon vented" is a translation error caused by the Austrian dialect, it should be "already prevented" or "already discussed".

--------------------------------------

> I am strictly against the unreasonable data collection and retention. This goes against all principles of data protection, privacy, and the EU itself.

--------------------------------------

> I am ITler. This legislative proposal should be rejected in the strongest possible terms! There must be no needless mass storage in the EU. This allows dictatorships and foreign spies to search these sensitive data. The legislative proposal therefore jeopardises the security of all Member States. In addition, this would be a disproportionate restriction of fundamental rights and would also be prohibited under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. QuickFreeze would be acceptable, but this proposal is simply disproportionate.

-> Again a translation error, "ITler" is a German term for someone who works in IT.

--------------------------------------

> I am opposing this initiative as it is another nail in the coffin of freedom. Nearly 300 hundred years ago one wise man stated: "Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety." If this initiative is approved, we (the ordinary people) will not be safer but we will loose another part of our liberties.

--------------------------------------

> Assuming the EC is not per se evil, and therefore is not intentionally creating a surveillance mechanism, we need to better appreciate the potential for misuse of such tools. Just like you cannot break encryption "one tiny bit", you cannot securely log communication and at the same time prevent this from falling into the wrong hands. For this reason, I am opposing this initiative.

--------------------------------------

> Data retention should only be at the request of the services, with confirmation by the court that there is no abuse. Any attempt to enter a private human zone should have very strong arguments. Requiring any backdoor for encrypted communication e2e is a security threat and should not even be discussed. Such backdoors will also be used by unauthorised persons.

----------------------------------------

--> There are many more but I obiously can't quote them all. Please go ahead and read them yourself. I highly recommend you to do so, as there are many very interesting and well thought out responses. Many even going into detail about the technical aspects of the proposal, and the implications it would have on our society.

## How can you help?

If you want to help, you can do so by giving your own feedback to the initiative.
Sadly, there is no petition or something like that, but you can still give your own feedback. The feedback is open until 18th June 2025, so you have plenty of time to think about it.
As a small warning, you have to be registered to give a feedback but I would recommend you to do so anyway, as it is a good way to stay informed about the initiative and other similar initiatives in the future.
You can give your feedback [here](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/14680-Impact-assessment-on-retention-of-data-by-service-providers-for-criminal-proceedings-_en).

## Final words

I know that this is a very controversial topic, and I know that there are many different opinions on this.
But I think it is important that we talk about it, and that we make our voices heard.
It's important that we stand up for our rights, and that we fight against this initiative, as it can also affect us in the future.
Not only digitally, but also in our real lives with psychological effects, and misuse of the data that is collected.

I hope that this article has helped you to understand the initiative better, and that you will take action against it.

Have a nice day, and stay safe!
