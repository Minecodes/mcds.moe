# Introduction
This page contains technical information about the website and its operation.

I'm doing this because I want to be transparent about how I handle everything here.

# Hosting
The main webserver is hosted on a VPS from [Netcup](https://www.netcup.de/). The server is located in Nuremberg, Germany.
Other hosters used are [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
My mail server is partially hosted with [Mailbox.org](https://mailbox.org/), and self-hosted.

This way, I can ensure that my content is always available, even if one of the services goes down.

# Software
The main webserver is running [FrankenPHP](https://frankenphp.dev/), a web server that is easy to configure and has a lot of features, and is based on [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com).
Most of the pages are static and generated using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), and the layout is done with [Astro](https://astro.build/).
The other pages are mostly hosted with self hosted services. My "firewall" against bots is [Anubis](https://anubis.techaro.lol/).

# Motivation
I'm doing this because I want to be transparent about how I handle everything here.
I also want to show that you can host a website with a limited budget and still have a good setup.

My goal with this website is also to provide useful information and share knowledge with others.

# Conclusion
I hope this page gave you a better understanding of how everything works here.
If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me.

Let's keep the web open and accessible for everyone. Let's keep it decentralized. Let's keep it free.
